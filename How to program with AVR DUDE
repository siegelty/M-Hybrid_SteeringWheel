How to program with AVR DUDE

Compiling
1. Make sure avr-libc is installed 
2. Use command avr-gcc -mmcu=at90can128 -g <your_code>.c -o <Output file>

Flashing Code
1. Plug in JTAG device
2. Power board with 12V
3. Compile (See compile section above)
4. run command avrdude -p c128 -P /dev/<GET YOUR USB DEVICE> -c jtag1 -U flash:w:<INSERT_YOUR_FILE>.hex 
  -p c128 is for the steering wheel
    - Go to http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/user-manual/avrdude_4.html for other devices avrdude supports
  -c jtag1 specifies the programming device we currerntly use
  -P specifies the usb port... use ls /dev to find the port to use
  -U specfies the method of memory manipulation (flash), the type of manipulation (w) and the file to use
